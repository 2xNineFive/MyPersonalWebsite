I created this branch to experiment with the concept of a branch in github. I also wanted to explain more about how this repo came to be. 

I created this repo locally on my laptop because I wanted a space to experiment with code. Now I am thinking that I would like to use this repo as a means to document my coding journey. I may have ADHD lol. Anyways...

I created this repo locally on my laptop, using git, and then pushed it to github. 
// I accidentally did a "git init" on my desktop and created pesky files that I did not want there. I took forever figuring out how to force delete stuff!

So, this repo is mainly an experiment thus far. I will update this readme.md as I clarify the purpose of this project.
